# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Some were more simple to understand than other. I mostly had to spend the most time on the functions lesson, it did include outside research on my end but it was productive. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It's going well, my biggest challenge is the time constraint between the Monday live session and the Thursday live sessions to complete the assignments. This is mostly because I'm also working a 9-5 job, leaving two evenings to complete the assignments. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learned a lot, from what functions are and thier syntax and the same for objects and how objects can be used which differ from arrays. I'd like to remember all of it as I can see may uses for them.
